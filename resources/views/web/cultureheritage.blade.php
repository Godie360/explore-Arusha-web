            <h5>Welcome to Arusha Culture Heritage</h5>
            The Arusha Cultural Heritage Centre is located on the Western edge of Arusha along Dodoma road, about 10
            kilometers, right after the first roundabout from Arusha town, opposite ‘Soko Mujinja’ a famous market in
            Arusha.
            </p>
            <p>
            <h5>Brief History</h5>
            Thought peculiar, the centre is home of the “Tanzanite” – a rare blue/violet gemstone only found in
            Tanzania, in a very small mining area near Mirerani Hills. In the main building, you shall be welcomed by
            Saif (his nickname) meaning “King of Tanzanite” due to his expansive knowledge of the precious gem. Saif
            tells all there is to know about the treasure. The stone can be purchased in different quantities at the
            premises, all dictated by the visitor’s pocket depth, of course. Away from tanzanite, the vicinity also
            encompasses other precious stones like Rubies, Emeralds, Tsavorite, Diamond, Sapphires and Opals. One can
            purchase a loose stone, together with hand-made jewellery and the designers at the center can help create a
            unique piece as the visitor may please.

            <h5>When To Go There</h5>
            The Arusha Cultural Heritage Centre is open daily throughout the year, and it's big enough that even if
            there are plenty of people there during your visit, it's unlikely to feel crowded. All of the shops are
            indoors and enclosed, making them ideal to visit rain or shine, but it’s still best to visit Arusha during
            the main June–October dry season, when you don’t have to worry about downpours.
