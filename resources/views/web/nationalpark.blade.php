            but in 1960 the area was set aside as Ngurdoto Crater National Park
            and after annexation of Mt. Meru the park name was changed to
            Arusha National Park with an area of 322 km2.
            The park can be accessed from Arusha town by road, which is about
            32 Kilometers away. It is about 40km from Kilimanjaro International
            airport.he park is also home to several cultural heritage sites,
            including the Ngurdoto Crater and Momela Lakes,
            which hold cultural significance for the local Maasai people.

            <h5>Conservation Effort In Arusha</h5>

            Arusha National Park is dedicated to preserving the unique ecosystem of the region and protecting the
            biodiversity of the area. The park's conservation efforts include anti-poaching patrols, habitat
            restoration, and research and monitoring of the park's flora and fauna. In recent years, the park has been
            successful in restoring and protecting the black and white colobus monkey populations, as well as the
            re-introduction of giraffes to the park. The park also works closely with local communities to promote
            sustainable tourism and provide alternative livelihoods for those who may otherwise turn to activities
            harmful to the park's wildlife and habitats.

            One of the park's most significant conservation efforts is the protection of Mount Meru, which is located
            within the park's boundaries. As an active volcano, Mount Meru plays a crucial role in maintaining the
            region's unique ecosystem. The park works closely with the local communities to ensure the sustainable use
            of natural resources in the area, including preventing deforestation and promoting sustainable agriculture
            practices. The conservation efforts in Arusha National Park are essential in preserving the natural beauty
            and biodiversity of the region for future generations to enjoy.
